# Games

**Games** is an interactive web application built with JavaScript on Code.org, bundling Hangman, Wordle, and Checkers in one place. This project began in **Spring 2022** after my AP exams during **10th grade**, when I decided to create a simple Hangman game to cure my boredom. Soon after, I incorporated Wordle into the same web app and renamed it “Games.” Eventually, I spent most of my effort crafting a Checkers game—by far the biggest and most exciting challenge of the three.

## About the Project

This collection of three classic games showcases my growth in programming and problem-solving. Each game has unique features and code structures, reflecting the lessons I learned along the way.

### Key Highlights

1. **Hangman**  
   - Multiple categories like countries, languages, and more.  
   - Classic hangman visuals that update with each incorrect guess.

2. **Wordle**  
   - A five-letter guessing game with color-coded feedback.  
   - Validity checks against an extensive word list to ensure realism.

3. **Checkers**  
   - A simplified board, single captures, and detection of blocked pieces.  
   - The largest and most challenging game I built, combining logic and user interaction.
